//! Source-level guard for the aarch64 NVMe patch.
//!
//! ## Why this is a test and not a comment
//!
//! The first version of `nvmed-aarch64-poll-fence.patch` woke external-event
//! waiters by **draining** `executor::LocalExecutor::external_event`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let waiters: Vec<_> = self.external_event.borrow_mut().drain().collect();
//! for (_, (task, flags_ptr)) in waiters {
//!     unsafe { flags_ptr.as_ptr().write(EventFlags::READ) };
//!     enqueue::<Hw>(task);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! That is a use-after-free. `flags_ptr` points *into* the caller's
//! `ExternalEventHandle`, and each entry may only be removed by that handle's
//! own `Drop`. Draining removed the entries out from under the still-live
//! handles, so `Drop`'s `remove` became a no-op: the map no longer knew about
//! the waiter, while the queued task still held a pointer into it. When the
//! handle was freed, the queued task wrote to recycled memory.
//!
//! The failure was silent and cross-process. The driver still booted, and
//! `cat` and `virtio-netd` died with a guard-page fault on roughly 4 of 6
//! identical invocations, with no disk I/O involved — the corrupted pages
//! belonged to whoever else had been handed them. A boot canary that only
//! checks "did it reach a login prompt" passes straight through this.
//!
//! These tests read the patch as text. They cannot prove runtime memory safety
//! — that needs the in-guest canary in `platform/scripts/test.sh`. What they do
//! is fail *instantly and locally* on the specific mistake that was made, so a
//! regression cannot be committed and discovered four hours later in CI.
